## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Check how the mediaqueries work on different screen sizes
- Check how the check status works in order to show or hide the answers block
- See how we can play with the overflow property in CSS in order to hide some parts of an image.
- See how we can play with the positions in order to accomodate the images in the desktop layout in the way we need.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS preprocessor

### What I learned

I learned the difference of how to use the property align-items and align-content with flexbox, with align-items we can align multiple items that are located in the same row and align content allows us to align multiple items in multiple rows and move them freely.


I really liked it!\

### Continued development

I will definetely continue learning on how to use flex properties and when to use them
