## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS preprocessor

### What I learned

I learned the difference of how to use the property align-items and align-content with flexbox, with align-items we can align multiple items that are located in the same row and align content allows us to align multiple items in multiple rows and move them freely.


### Continued development

I will definetely continue learning on how to use flex properties and when to use them properly
